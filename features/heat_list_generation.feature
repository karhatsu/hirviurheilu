Feature: Heat list generation
  In order to save time
  As an official
  I want to generate heat lists automatically with certain rules

    And I am on the official race page of "Air race"
    When I follow "Alkukilpailun erien asettelu arpomalla"

    Then I should see "Kilpailulle pitää määrittää ratojen lukumäärä ja ammuntapaikkojen lukumäärä ennen kuin voi arpoa eräluettelon" in an error message
    When I follow "Perustiedot"
    And I fill in "2" for "Ratojen määrä"
