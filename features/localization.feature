  In order to understand the service
  As a Swedish user
  I want to use the system in Swedish

  @javascript
  Scenario: Change language, change page, change the language again
    Given I am on the home page
    And I follow "P책 svenska"
    Then I should be on the Swedish home page
    And I should see "T채vlingar"
    When I follow "T채vlingar"
    Then I should see "Hirviurheilu - T채vlingar" within ".body__on-top-title"
    When I follow "Suomeksi"
    Then I should see "Hirviurheilu - Kilpailut" within ".body__on-top-title"
